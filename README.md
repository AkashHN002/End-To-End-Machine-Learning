# End to End MachineLearning Projects

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning project  showcasing modular coding practices with classes . It includes Data ingestion, Data transformation , model management, and deployment, and organizes the project into a structured folder system for better maintainability and scalability.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structured folders:

- `artifiacts/`: Contains datasets used in the project and Contains the machine learning models, including base and derived classes.
- `src/`: Contains scripts for running experiments, training models, and evaluating performance.


## Setting Up the Project with MLflow


Ensure all project dependencies are installed by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Experiments and Managing Models 

To run experiments and manage models , execute the script Data_ingestion.py within the `src/` directory:

```
python src/Data_ungestion.py
```
To run the maodel in localhost, execute the scriptt app.py 
```
python app.py
```
This script demonstrates the lifecycle of a Machine Learning project, including initializing an experiment, logging parameters, metrics, and models, and tracking experiments using modular coding practices.
